### **Introdauction**

Our team members gathering together because our love toward video games. League of Legends and Teamfight Tactics are our favorites. Teamfight Tactics is a multiplayer strategy game where the ultimate goal of the player is to defeat other players. Therefore, understanding the psychology and strategy of other players is the key to winning the game. We are all familiar with TFT's mechanics and wish to beat other players and achieve higher rankings. Researching Teamfight Tactics' ranked stats caters to our interests and allows us to learn more about other players to improve our game strategy. Furthermore, the essence of video games is code and data. Studying the data on TFT allows me to understand how game makers design the interaction of game characters and how to balance competitive games in order to enhance the game's playability and the player's gaming experience.
